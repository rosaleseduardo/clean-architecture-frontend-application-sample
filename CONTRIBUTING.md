   - Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

2. Submitting Pull Requests

   - Create your branch from `main`.
   - Follow the coding style guidelines (Check Code Tours within the project).

      If you're unfamiliar with how to use this tool, we have a helpful
      [tutorial](https://youtu.be/c2J_o7ZkBbM?si=USeZtRQ3q5N5-kLn) video for you
      to watch. Additionally, you can find the
      [reference](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour)
      to the required plugin for installation in VSCode.
   - Include tests for your changes if applicable.
   - Ensure your code passes all existing tests and does not introduce new
   issues.
   - Submit a pull request and provide a clear description of the changes. More
   details [here](#how-to-make-a-commit).

3. Code of Conduct

   - Be respectful and considerate of others.
   - Engage in constructive and inclusive discussions.

## How You Can Help

There are many ways to contribute, including but not limited to:

- **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please let us know by opening an issue.
- **Suggesting Features:** Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear
about it.
- **Writing Code:** Submit pull requests to fix bugs or add new features.
- **Improving Documentation:** Help us make our documentation clearer and more
comprehensive.
- **Testing:** Test the project on different platforms and report any issues.

## Development requirements

The development considered to be included in the project's codebase, should
comply with the following criteria:

1. **Do not push a commit if the development is not completed**. Each commit is
expected to be associated to a single ticket number, it means that
**only one commit is allowed per ticket assigned.** (if you need to update your
branch with the latest changes from the main branch, please perform a rebase)
2. **Each commit must deliver a stable version of the app.**
3. The commit must state the title of the task/subtask that was taken,
**_e.g MDC-000 This is the title of the task_**
4. Add a description providing the answers to the following questions:
   - How the development in the branch will add value to the project?
   - (Optional) Is there any remaining work to be done? Please, provide the
   ticket number that will cover this development.

### _**EXCEPTIONS:**_

_If there's a need to merge something that wasn't initially scoped (unexpected bug or behavior), it can be done by following these criteria:_

- _The commit description should state the issue that arose and the temporary fix applied._
- _It must reference the ticket created to cover that bug fixing._

## How to make a commit

Make usage of the command `pnpm run commit:changes` to make a new commit. This will prompt you to define:

1. Type of change you're commiting (a list will be shown to you).
2. Scope of the change (optional).
3. A short, imperative tense description of the change (Refer to step 3 from the previous list)
4. A longer description of the change (Refer to step 4 from the previous list)
5. Notify if there's a breking change
   - If yes, provide details.
   - If no, proceed to the next step.
6. Notify if this commit affect any open issues
   - If yes, add the issue references.
   - If no, proceed to the next step.
7. The commit will be added to the git history.
8. Push the previously created commit to the remote repository.
